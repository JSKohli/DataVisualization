#Data Visualization

This repository was constructed by merging two distinct repositories - one for each programming assignment of the course Data Visualization - a MOOC by UIUC on Coursera.

Even though it started out as an assignment, I hope to keep trying new things with these two datasets and their respective visualizations.

As of 18/8/15, this repo has only two projects. However, any and all of my future open-source projects on visualizing data shall also find home here.
